Reusable HTML Editors for Labelbox

This respository has one folder for each custom HTML editor for Labelbox.  

### Editor List

#### eRetailer Shopping Cart Comparison
Built For ecommerce retailers to label data that drives structured data catalogs. A big problem for retailers is ability to deduplicate their listings.  They have many different stores and vendors that sell products on their sites with different listing information.  This makes it very difficult to create a simple, consisten product catalog.   

This HTML editor allows a labeler to easiy compare two shopping cart listings side by side to determine if they pertain to the same product in their product catalog.  The side by side comparison makes the structure of two listings identical, eliminating any labeler bias in judgement that may confuse when two listings are for the same product.  

Configured by providing a JSON payload that dynamically generates the listing.
